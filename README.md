## Hello there! 
### You can call me Signal Hijack. (^^ゞ
I'm an indie game developer who is obsessed with retro games and graphics, normally from the 90's.
I build all of my games from scrach; I program my own engines, make my own 3D models and textures, and compose my own soundtracks.

#### I generally program in C, but some other languages I use are:
- C++
- Python
- Java
- Lua
- Rust
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (For web-based projects)
- BASIC (For basic projects; no pun intended ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )
- MIPS Assembly (For PSX & N64 projects)
- 6502 Assembly (For Atari 2600 & NES projects)
